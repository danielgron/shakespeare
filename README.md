## SORTING ALGORITHMS

This program was implemented to read all the words in a file which in this assignment,
it is all the works of Shakespeare and sort it alphabetically by using different types of sorting: 
Insertion sort, Selection sort and Merge Sort (Bottom-up and Top-Down).

In conclusion, the fastest algorithm is merge sort, top-down and bottom-up are just so close since it is both implementations 
for merge sort in different ways. And insertion sort is faster than selection sort.

OUTPUT: (This is a result based only in partial array of words from the file with a size of 100.000)

Selection Sort TIME:33.406s

Insertion Sort TIME:0.202s

Merge Sort Bottom-up TIME:0.018s

Merge Sort Top-Down TIME:0.039s

## SEARCHING ALGORITHMS

This contains implementation of symbol table searching algorithms: LinkedSymbolTable, ArraySymbolTable, HashSymbolTable and BalancedTreeSymbolTable (Red-Black).

After testing these algorithms with 100.000 words from Shakespeare a couple of times, it turned out that Hash Symbol Table is the fastest.

Output:

Linked Symbol Table: 0.397
Array Symbol Table: 5.405
Balanced Tree Symbol Table: 0.036
Hash Symbol Table: 0.018
